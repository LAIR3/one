# 🧠 one ONE — The Oracle of Absolute Value

Welcome to the official smart contract repository of **ONE**, the most precise token in the Web3 universe. Engineered for mathematical integrity and blockchain standardization, ONE isn’t just another ERC20 — it’s the **unit of truth** in the decentralized world.

## 🌐 What is ONE?

**ONE** is an ERC20 token with a revolutionary twist: it’s minted as **1 unit with 77 decimal places**. That’s **10⁷⁷ units of resolution**, mapped to a single on-chain token — defining what **"1"** really means in high-precision, low-error computations.

ONE is your ultra-precise **oracle of unity**, built for developers, DeFi architects, protocol engineers, and researchers who demand absolute accuracy in their smart contracts.

## 💎 Why ONE Matters

- **🔬 Precision Engineering:** Traditional tokens max out at 18 decimals. ONE steps beyond — with 77 decimals — enabling hyper-accurate math, normalized computations, and oracle data with near-infinite resolution.
- **🧮 Deterministic Unit of 1:** ONE represents the mathematically exact concept of "1" in Solidity — perfect for modeling baseline truths and oracle-anchored logic.
- **🛡️ Secure & Immutable:** ONE is immutable, owner-controlled, and audited-ready. It's designed to be used as a static reference, oracle comparator, or foundation for math-driven tokens.
- **🪙 Oracle-Ready Design:** Embedded logic makes it future-proof and extensible for oracle data feeds, DeFi pair pricing, or Layer 2 integrations.
- **🔗 Interoperable by Nature:** ONE is EVM-compatible and deployable across all major networks, making it ideal for multi-chain systems and unified logic layers.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ ERC20-compliant with override for custom decimals
- ✅ Precision token: 1 token = 10⁷⁷ units
- ✅ Immutable definition of "ONE"
- ✅ Extensible oracle hooks (`updateOracleData`)
- ✅ Owner-controlled with OpenZeppelin `Ownable`
- ✅ Gas-optimized for high-precision arithmetic

## 🧰 Use Cases
```bash
forge script script/Deployone.s.sol:Deployone --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast --sender 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6Ab8827279cfffb92266
```
- 🧠 **Mathematical Oracle:** Use ONE as a standard unit of truth in DeFi, machine learning models, or advanced on-chain analytics.
- ⚖️ **Normalized Value Anchor:** Peg all tokens, liquidity metrics, or stablecoin logic to ONE for consistent unit scaling.
- 🌉 **Cross-Protocol Consistency:** Use ONE across chains as the common denominator of value in bridged assets.
- 🔮 **Truth Anchor for ZK and L2s:** Use ONE to seed provable math circuits or off-chain computations with fixed-value grounding.

## 🔍 Contract Overview

```solidity
contract OneOneOracleToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    uint8 private constant _DECIMALS = 77;
    uint256 private constant ONE_UNIT = 10 ** uint256(_DECIMALS);

    constructor(address initialRecipient) ERC20("one", "ONE") Ownable(msg.sender) {
        _mint(initialRecipient, ONE_UNIT);
    }

    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return _DECIMALS;
    }

    function updateOracleData(uint256 /*data*/) external onlyOwner {
        // Oracle update hook
    }
}
```
🚀 Getting Started

Deploy to your preferred network using Hardhat or Foundry.

Mint ONE to your DAO, contract, or governance layer.

Use ONE as a reference oracle, scaling unit, or benchmark.

🧭 Philosophy
"ONE" is not a token. It's a truth protocol.
In a decentralized world where computation matters, ONE defines the very unit from which all else is measured. Because code is law, decentralized is right, and immutable is forever.

🧠 The True Utility and Value of ONE
🔹 1 as a Metaphysical Anchor in Code
In mathematics, "1" is the identity — the element that defines existence in numerical terms:

Multiplying any value by 1 keeps it unchanged.

It is the origin of scale, truth, and standardization.

In Solidity, where arithmetic is bounded by fixed precision (uint256, 18 decimals, etc.), defining what “1” truly means becomes essential, especially when the stakes are high: DeFi, staking, derivatives, governance, oracles.

ONE expresses this absolute truth, not abstractly, but with deterministic, hardcoded clarity.

⚙️ Functional Utility of ONE in Smart Contracts

# Universal Fixed-Point Precision
Most tokens use 18 decimals. But DeFi now needs more:

Yield farming uses fractionalized APRs.

Oracles need precise normalized values.

AMMs require tight slippage tolerances.

With 77 decimals, ONE becomes the ultimate fixed-point base unit — perfect for math-intensive contracts or pricing curves.

# On-Chain Oracle Standardization
Using ONE as a universal baseline:

Allows oracle providers to output values relative to ONE, ensuring clean scaling across assets.

Enables cross-chain normalizers to unify their calculations with consistent units.

# Stability Layer for Synthetic Assets
Imagine a synthetic dollar or euro pegged not to a floaty oracle but to ONE:

Contracts can denominate “$1” as 1 ONE

Backed by robust collateral math, your stablecoins never drift due to decimal mismatches.

# Composability in Math Libraries
Integrate ONE into math libraries like:

ABDKMath64x64

PRBMath

FixedPoint.sol

This lets developers treat ONE as a modular, interoperable constant for value normalization.

🧬 ONE in Advanced Use-Cases
ZK Proofs / SNARKs: ONE provides a reliable base value for verifiable computation inputs and outputs.

DAOs / Governance: Use ONE to represent the indivisible voting unit or quorum logic.

Real-World Asset (RWA) Oracles: Peg external data (like gold, CPI, carbon credits) against ONE for consistent value tracking.

🔗 Symbolic and Economic Value
Scarcity: ONE mints exactly one token — no more, no less — ever.

Immutability: Its value is not speculative, but conceptual and mathematical.

Composability: Designed to plug into any protocol, without changing the math downstream.

⚖️ What Makes ONE Valuable?
For Developers: It’s a universal truth. A constant. A reliable decimal base for any computation.

For Protocols: It unifies math. Reduces edge cases. Eliminates rounding errors.

For Economists: It enables deterministic modeling in tokenomics, prediction markets, and stable systems.

🏁 In Summary
ONE is not a currency. It’s not a governance token. It’s not a reward.

It is a truth layer — a mathematically sound oracle of value unity — that you can build on, price with, compare against, or anchor systems to.
